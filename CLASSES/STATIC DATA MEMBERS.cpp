/*

--> We have seen that, only data members are instantized in every object.
--> But some times that value of data member should be same for all the objects in that class.
--> In such cases, the static members are used.

	RULES :-

	1.they can be public as well as private.
	2.If you forget to initialise them, you will get a compilation error.
	3.Static members share the memory for all instances of a class.
